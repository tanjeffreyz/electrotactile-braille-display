The Electrotactile Braille Display (ETBD) is a refreshable braille display that uses electrical pulses to simulate the feeling of braille dots on the user's fingertips. 
Because it has no moving parts, the ETBD has the potential to be much lighter, thinner, and cheaper compared to mechanical braille displays, which use physical braille pins.
